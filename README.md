gHost - unHosted Photo Album
=====================

**gHost** is an experimental web application
based on HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

**gHost** uses **JQuery** and two new great technologies called
**WebRTC** and **RemoteStorageJS**; used, respectively,
to capture the webcam stream without plugins and
to host the pictures taken, leaving users in control of their data.
